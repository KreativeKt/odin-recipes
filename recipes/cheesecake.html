<h5>Description</h5></div>

<p class="smaller">This creamy dessert has always been a huge hit in my family so it was only
    right that I found the perfect recipe for me and <strong>mastered</strong> it. This will 
    work well with any topping of your choice regardless if you make your own, or just use
    a store bought canned fruit. It will a produce a cheesecake that you may <em>think</em>
    looks small, but the slices are thick and delicious!
