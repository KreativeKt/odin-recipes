<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Most people tend to use hamburger meat in their spaghetti but my preference 
    is <em>turkey</em>. On average I tend not to use any meatballs, for no 
    real reason as they are enjoyed by my household. I haven't tried making
    my own tomato sauce yet but <strong>really</strong> would like too.
