<h1>Garlic Knot Chicken Alfredo</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Originally as you might see from the picture this recipe was made to be a ring.
    I chose not to do it that way because there isn't a bundt pan in my kitchen
    currently. The first time making this, I followed it strictly how tasty showed
    me but just added my own seasonings and personally found that it could be better.
    This recipe also uses store-bought alfredo but feel free to make your own!
